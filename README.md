# CLEO - AI-Powered Sales Assistant

CLEO is a revolutionary tool designed to streamline the sales process by gathering customer data and generating tailored sales proposals efficiently. Combining advanced language models and speech recognition technology, it enables seamless interaction via voice or text inputs, making it ideal for live conversations and phone calls. The assistant engages users interactively, extracting essential details from documents provided by customers and performing information gap analysis to ensure proposal completeness. By automating tedious tasks and improving data accuracy, it empowers sales teams to focus on building strong customer relationships and closing deals effectively.

## Project Overview and Architecture

In response to the challenges faced by sales teams in gathering comprehensive customer data and generating tailored sales proposals efficiently, we propose the development of an AI-powered Sales Assistant. This assistant leverages advanced language models (LLMs) and speech recognition technologies to streamline the sales process, enhance customer engagements, and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of sales proposals.

Key Features:

1. Voice Activation: The AI Sales Assistant supports both voice and text inputs, enabling seamless interaction during live conversations such as meetings and phone calls. This feature ensures accessibility and ease of use for sales representatives, allowing them to gather information and generate proposals in real-time.
2. Interactive Engagement: Through intelligent questioning, the AI assistant engages with users to gather relevant customer data necessary for creating tailored sales proposals. By dynamically adapting its queries based on the context of the conversation, the assistant ensures that no critical details are overlooked.
3. Document Analysis: The AI Sales Assistant possesses the capability to analyze documents provided by customers, such as PDF files, to extract essential information required for drafting sales proposals. This feature eliminates manual data entry tasks and accelerates the proposal generation process by automatically capturing pertinent details.
4. Information Gap Analysis: To further enhance the accuracy and completeness of sales proposals, the assistant performs information gap analysis. By identifying any missing details or inconsistencies in the gathered data, the assistant prompts users to provide additional information necessary for completing the proposal accurately.
