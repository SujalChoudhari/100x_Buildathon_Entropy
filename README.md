## Overview and Architecture

1. **Overview:**

   In response to the challenges faced by sales teams in gathering comprehensive customer data and generating tailored sales proposals efficiently, we propose the development of an AI-      powered Sales Assistant. This assistant leverages advanced language models (LLMs) and speech recognition technologies to streamline the sales process, enhance customer engagements,       and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of sales proposals.

   **Key Features:**

   - Voice Activation: The AI Sales Assistant supports both voice and text inputs, enabling seamless interaction during live conversations such as meetings and phone calls. This feature       ensures accessibility and ease of use for sales representatives, allowing them to gather information and generate proposals in real-time.
   - Interactive Engagement: Through intelligent questioning, the AI assistant engages with users to gather relevant customer data necessary for creating tailored sales proposals. By          dynamically adapting its queries based on the context of the conversation, the assistant ensures that no critical details are overlooked.
   - Document Analysis: The AI Sales Assistant possesses the capability to analyze documents provided by customers, such as PDF files, to extract essential information required for             drafting sales proposals. This feature eliminates manual data entry tasks and accelerates the proposal generation process by automatically capturing pertinent details.
   - Information Gap Analysis: To further enhance the accuracy and completeness of sales proposals, the assistant performs information gap analysis. By identifying any missing details or       inconsistencies in the gathered data, the assistant prompts users to provide additional information necessary for completing the proposal accurately.
   - AI Voice Call: The AI Sales Assistant also offers an AI Voice Call feature, enabling communication between the assistantand customer. This streamlines communication with clients by        eliminating the need to switch between different applications or devices. With AI Voice Call, the AI Sales Assistant proficiently pitches products and addresses customer                  queries with precision. This streamlined process ensures efficient communication and empowers sales representatives to engage with customers effectively, fostering meaningful             interactions and driving sales growth."
